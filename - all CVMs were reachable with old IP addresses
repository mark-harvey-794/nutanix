- all CVMs were reachable with old IP addresses
- /etc/hosts  /home/nutanix/data/zookeeper_monitor/zk_server_config_file were having all old IP addresses
- /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-eth0 was having all old IP addresses
- cluster service was stopped and .node_reconfigure file doesn't exist on all CVMs.

Followed manual IP address update procedure.
- Did put the cluster to reconfigure mode with "cluster reconfig" command
- updated eth0 interface info with new IP from all CVMs one by one
  /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-eth0
- Updated zookeeper config file with the new IP address, then +1 on its version info and updated modifier to GENESIS from all CVMs one by one
- Updated zookeeper server info on /etc/hosts file with new IP address from all CVMs one by one
- Restarted all CVMs one by one(sudo reboot)
- Changed all hypervisor IP address to new one then rebooted all hypervisors
- Now all CVMs were reachable with new IP addresses.
- Removed reconfigure marker file from all CVMs(rm /home/nutanix/.node_reconfigure)
- Stopped zookeeper service(genesis stop zookeeper) from all CVMs one by one
- Restarted genesis from all CVMs one by one(genesis restart)
- Wait 5 mins to sync-up new information.
- Checked new IP addresses from zookeeper
* svmips
* allssh 'cat /etc/hosts'
* allssh "cat /home/nutanix/data/zookeeper_monitor/zk_server_config_file"
* edit-zkmigration-state edit_zkserver_config_proto
* zeus_config_printer | grep -B 20 zookeeper_myid | egrep "external_ip|zookeeper_myid"

- Confirmed everything is reflected correctly then started cluster service again(cluster start)
- Everything came up properly
- Updated Prism Virtual IP and Data service IP from cli
*  ncli cluster edit-info external-ip-address=new-ip-address
*  ncli cluster edit-info external-data-services-ip-address=new-ip-address
All services are up & running fine.
